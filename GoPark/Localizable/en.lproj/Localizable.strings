We will be adding more parking areas in the near future.\n\n\n\n2. How do I know if the parking spot is occupied?\n\nWhen click the parking spot on the map, a green dot in the pop-up menu indicates that the parking spot is available. A red dot indicates that the parking spot is occupied.\n\n\n\n3. How do you set a reminder?\n\nWhen you confirm a parking spot, you can turn on the reminder. The system will set a reminder automatically based on the parking rules and the confirmed time.\n\n\n\n4. What is the Nearby page?\n\nThis page displays 30 parking spots around your current location and it is sorted by distance. The green line under the cost indicates a parking spot is currently available, and a red line indicates that the parking spot is occupied.\n\n\n\n5. How do you use the scanner?\n\nKeep your finger pressed on the screen and a result will popup if the parking sign is recognised. You can also open the flashlight if needed.";
