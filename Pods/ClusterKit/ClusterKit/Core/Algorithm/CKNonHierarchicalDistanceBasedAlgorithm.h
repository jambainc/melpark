/**
 A simple clustering algorithm with O(nlog n) performance.
 
 Non-hierarchical distance analysis aims to find a grouping of annotations which minimises the distance between an annotation and its cluster. These algorithm will iteratively assign annotations to different groups while searching for the optimal distance.
 
 1. Iterate througth the annotations that are not yet clusterized found in the given rect.
 2. Create a cluster with the center of the annotation.
 3. Add all items that are within a certain distance to the cluster.
 4. Move any items out of an existing cluster if they are closer to another cluster.
 
 CKNonHierarchicalDistanceBasedAlgorithm is an objective-c implementation of the non-hierarchical distance based clustering algorithm used by Google maps.
