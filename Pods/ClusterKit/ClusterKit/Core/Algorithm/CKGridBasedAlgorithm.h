/**
 A simple grid-based clustering algorithm with O(n) performance.
 
 The great advantage of grid-based clustering is its significant reduction of the computational complexity, especially for clustering very large data sets. The grid-based clustering approach differs from the conventional clustering algorithms in that it is concerned not with the data points but with the value space that surrounds the data points.
 
 This grid-based implementation consists of the following the steps:
 
 1. Iterate througth the annotations found in the given rect.
 2. Associate each annotation to a grid cell. The rect is partitioned in a finite number of cells using the cell size property at the given zoom level.
 3. Annotation are added to a centroid cluster {@see CKCentroidCluster} by default.
